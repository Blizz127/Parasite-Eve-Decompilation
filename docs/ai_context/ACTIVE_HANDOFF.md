# ACTIVE HANDOFF

Single source of truth for current working state. Read this first; update after
every meaningful change. Prefer shortening over accruing.

## Current state

| Fact | Value | Derive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Branch / tip | `main` (docs bank atop production/toolchain tip `f0b9155`) | `git branch --show-current` / `git log --oneline -1` |
| Phase | **5EP loop-capability bank; production remains 5EM-boot-6a8d4 / 212 exact leaves** | `scripts/verify_us.sh` summary + parked-probe record below |
| Matching C leaves | **212** | `grep -c ',\s*c,' configs/USA/disc1.yaml` |
| Yaml asm segments | **145** | `grep -c ',\s*asm\]' configs/USA/disc1.yaml` |
| Era leaf compiles | **55** | `grep -c '^era_compile \|^\w*=1 era_compile ' scripts/build_us.sh` |
| Target SHA-1 | `452fb033f2eaa4b18aa20a5bca60b8125af3a37b` | `scripts/build_us.sh` compare |
| Progress | https://blizz127.github.io/parasite-eve-progress/ | `scripts/publish_progress.sh` |

**Yaml `asm` segments are not remaining functions.** One segment can hold
dozens of glabels; do not subtract it from anything as a function count.

Oracle: bare `scripts/build_us.sh` exits 0 on exact SHA-1; `scripts/verify_us.sh`
reports Phase 5EM-boot-6a8d4 / 212. Disc images / `asm/` / `build/` / `tools/era/`
are git-ignored inputs — never commit them.

**Toolchain**

- Default leaves: GCC 14.2 in Distrobox `pe-mipsel` (Phase 4J flags; selective
  `-G 8` / `-fno-delayed-branch` / `-fno-tree-ter`).
- Era leaves (opt-in): `scripts/setup_era.sh` → `era_compile` =
  cpp → cc1 → maspsx → GNU as, typically `-O2 -G0` (some leaves `-O1 -G0`).
- Era maspsx: `ERA_ASPSX_VER=2.21` + `--dont-expand-li`. **Why:**
  `expand_load_immediate` turns positive small `li` into `ori`; ROM wants
  `addiu`. Defer `li` expansion to GNU as. Same config also preserves
  large-literal `lui;ori` (cc1 emits PSY-Q `li` high + `ori` low natively).
  Do **not** bump aspsx-version casually — that also flips `nop_at_expansion`
  / `addiu_at`.
- **Vendored maspsx LOCAL PATCH:** `tools/era/maspsx/maspsx/__init__.py` is
  repo-tracked (`.gitignore` negations; `setup_era.sh` re-clones upstream
  AROUND it, restores the tracked file from git if absent). Patch 1 =
  **sw-store delay-slot fill**, opt-in per `era_compile` line via env
  `MASPSX_FILL_STORE_DELAY_SLOT=1`: an absolute `sw $r,SYM` macro immediately
  before a bare `j $31` is emitted as `lui $at,%hi` / `j $31` /
  `sw $r,%lo($at)`. sw only — sb/sh macro stores and multi-store epilogues
  are ROM-proven to stay pre-jr with a nop slot (e.g. func_8003FFAC vs
  func_8007FBC0: identical C shape, different ROM scheduling — the original
  units were assembled with different ASPSX scheduling).
- Patch 2 landed at `f0b9155`: **three-word indexed symbolic store**, opt-in
  per leaf via `MASPSX_THREE_WORD_SYMBOL_STORE=1`. Standalone
  `store $r,SYMBOL($index)` uses the retail/ASPSX-2.30-shaped
  `lui $at,%hi` / `addu $at,$at,$index` / `store $r,%lo($at)` sequence;
  compound semicolon lines retain the 2.21 four-word expansion, and indexed
  loads are untouched. Flag-off rebuild is the exact 212-leaf retail SHA.
- Maspsx stdin: closed with `</dev/null` in `era_compile` (non-TTY hang under
  agent sockets). Bare `scripts/build_us.sh` is fine.

## How to count (do not hand-maintain)

```bash
grep -c ',\s*c,' configs/USA/disc1.yaml            # C leaves
grep -c ',\s*asm\]' configs/USA/disc1.yaml          # yaml asm segments (NOT fn count)
grep -c '^era_compile \|^\w*=1 era_compile ' scripts/build_us.sh  # era leaf compiles
git log --oneline -1
```

**Do not** count `asm/disc1/*.s` from disk. That tree is git-ignored and
contains orphans, stale duplicates, and nop-pads. **Yaml is the source of truth.**
Known stale orphans (counter ignore-list): `2E7D0.s` (superseded by live
`2E7D8.s`) and `807C.s` (stale duplicate of live `2A0C.s`; unreferenced in
yaml). Keep both out of function scans.

**asm/ sync invariant:** `$at` family totals from
`tools/analysis/at_absolute_store_counter.py` hard-fail (no SUMMARY) when asm/
is missing units or still holds glabels for yaml C leaves. Re-split with
`scripts/split_us.sh` before planning off a family count. Leaf count stays
yaml-only and still works when asm/ is stale.

## Proven era fingerprints (evidence, not claims)

| Fingerprint | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `move` → `addu` in delay slot | Proven 5EA / 5EB / 5EC / 5ED |
| `$v0` / `$v1` allocation | Proven 5EC / 5ED (sb+ret0 reuse) |
| `li` const materialization (`addiu` not `ori`) | Proven 5EC via `--dont-expand-li` |
| `$at` absolute `sw` macro expansion | Proven by scratch probe; integrated exact in 5EE |
| Branch delay-slot constant hoist (`beqz` slot) | **PROVEN** (5EG-first-branch): era cc1 `-O1 -G 8` reproduces the retail schedule on `func_8004F448` word-for-word |
| `$a0`-in/`$v0`-out + redundant double store | **PROVEN** (5EH): era `-O2 -G8` preserves both stores + `addu` return-0 on `func_800438C0`; GCC 14.2 `-O1` merges stores and emits `move` — **era required for value-returning leaves**; era+gp `-G8` first proven here |
| Non-leaf stack frame + `jal` | **PROVEN** (5EI; repeated as volume in 5EK): era matches the `func_800197D0` / `func_800197F0` void-callee twins — `addiu $sp,-0x18` / `sw $ra,0x10($sp)` / `jal`+nop / `lw $ra` / `addiu $v0,1` / `jr $ra` with the `addiu $sp,+0x18` teardown **in the `jr` delay slot**, word-exact; 197F0 uses `-O2 -G0` and adds no primitive |
| Outgoing `$a0` + `jal` after double dereference | **PROVEN** (5EJ-outgoing-arg): era `-O2 -G0` on `func_80019484(int **)` emits `lw $v0,0($a0)` / load-delay nop / `lw $a0,0($v0)` / `jal func_800438C0` + nop, then the proven return-1 frame teardown shape; all 11 words exact |
| Return-forwarded `$v0` + teardown-before-`jr` epilogue | **PROVEN** (5EL-return-forwarding): era `-O2 -G0` on `func_8007F7A8` emits the frame + `jal func_8007FCAC` + nop, forwards `$v0` untouched, then `lw $ra`; `addiu $sp,+0x18`; `jr $ra`; nop. Era reproduces this per-function schedule as well as 197D0/F0's opposite teardown-in-slot schedule |
| Straight-line boot pointer-layout scheduling | **PROVEN, COMPILER-CONSTRAINED C** (5EM-boot-6a8d4): era `-O2 -G0` matches all 68 words / 19 absolute pointer stores in retail order. Both the initial plain-local source and one retail-order retry allocate cursors to `$a0/$a1`, constants to `$v0/$v1`, and sink `D_800B0E28` past `D_800B0E2C/E30`. The exact fallback therefore uses the established explicit-register convention (`$v0/$v1` cursors, `$a0/$a1` constants); it is target-specific matching C, not portable natural C |
| Counting-loop back-edge scheduling | **PROVEN; VOLUME-ELIGIBLE** (5EN/5EP `func_8006A674` probe): era `-O2 -G0` puts pointer advances in all five retail back-branch delay slots — `bnez` up-counters (`$a0+4`, `$v1+2`, `$a1+8`) and `bgez` down-counters (`$a3-4`, `$v0-4`) — and preserves the final store in the `jr` delay slot. The leaf remains parked for unrelated constant-hoist scheduling; the loop primitive passed. |
| Indexed global-array store expansion | **PROVEN, TOOL-SOLVED** (`f0b9155`): per-leaf `MASPSX_THREE_WORD_SYMBOL_STORE=1` reproduces `lui` / indexed `addu` / `%lo` store and removed the extra L3 word in `func_8006A674` (153→152 words). Default off is byte-identical. |
| `lui;ori` large-literal synthesis | **PROVEN** (capability probe): both bit15-clear and bit15-set; cc1 emits PSY-Q `li` high + `ori` low; ROM-exact under 2.21 + `--dont-expand-li` |

All four fingerprints from the original 5EA era claim are now proven in bytes.
The “~290 era-blocked functions” figure remains an **ESTIMATE**, not a countdown.

## Known-open families

- **sb+ret0:** **done** in 5ED (family closed).
- **`$at` absolute-store population:** counter committed
  (`tools/analysis/at_absolute_store_counter.py`). The historical integration
  inventory was **18 pre-jr** / 14 delay-slot / 5 sb-sh; the current yaml-live
  population is **0 pre-jr** / **0 delay-slot** / 5 sb-sh. Weak-int policy **NO**.
  - **Pinned by 5EG-readers:**
    - `D_8009D240` = `unsigned short *`, `D_8009D260` = `unsigned char *`
      via `func_8008AB1C` (era `-O1 -G0`).
    - `D_800A1870` = `void (*)(void)` via `func_80042B6C` (era `-O2 -G0`).
  - **Integrated:** `func_80085728`; 5EI readers-typed trio; 5EJ `D_8009D28C`
    int-state (4); 5EK `D_8009D270` unsigned flags (2); **5EF all 14
    delay-slot `sw` members**. The pilot `func_8007FBC0` plus the remaining 13
    typed leaves are integrated exact. Leaf count **212**.
  - **Delay-slot shape: FAMILY CLOSED (5EF).** Vendored maspsx LOCAL PATCH
    (`MASPSX_FILL_STORE_DELAY_SLOT=1`) fills the `j $31` slot with the trailing
    absolute `sw`. Pilot gate exact + objdump-probed (`3C01800A 03E00008
    AC2436A0`). The remaining 13 members now have per-global typing evidence,
    and all 14 members pass the full exact-match gate; see
    `docs/ai_context/PHASE5EF_TYPING.md`.
  - **sb-sh-five: RECLASSIFIED — never tool-blocked.** ROM words show sb/sh
    macro stores stay **pre-jr with a nop slot** (func_80033A2C sb,
    func_800C6ED8/C6EE8 sh, func_800C6EC0 dual-sh; func_8001A374 has a
    cc1-filled `li` slot). Current maspsx already emits that shape; the patch
    deliberately does not touch sb/sh. Remaining work is typing + integration,
    toolchain-independent.
  - **Still open (typing):** remaining opaque-word (`D_800A1868` other writers).
- **`lui;ori`:** **CAPABILITY-VERIFIED** — not a blocker. Constant-heavy
  computational functions (mult/div/mask, e.g. ÷100 via `0x51EB851F`) are
  approachable as a **separate future phase**; synthesis itself is solved.
- Complex `$gp` / GTE / BIOS / mult-div / large non-leaves: still open; not
  inventoried here. Path forward is matching real logic, not harvesting
  trivial setters.

## Boot Rung 1

```text
main -> func_8006A64C -> { func_8006A8D4 ✓ exact C,
                           func_8006A674 parked asm }
```

- `func_8006A674` is **PARKED, not a 213th leaf**. Loops are proven; L2 store /
  increment phrasing and the flag/L4 allocation were resolved with semantic
  `$v0`/`$a3` pins. Exactness still needs control over the repeated pinned
  `$v1 = -1` / shared-constant hoists: **45 words remain**, in
  `0x8006A684–0x8006A6A8`, `0x8006A770–0x8006A790`, and
  `0x8006A7E8–0x8006A84C`. The bounded candidate is recorded by stash message
  `park phase5ep func_8006A674 bounded pinning pass (45-word scheduler residual)`.
- Both boot callees are proven `void func(void)`. Therefore
  `func_8006A64C` may be attempted **now** with `func_8006A674` declared as an
  external `void(void)` function; the callee does not need to be matched C for
  the trivial two-call wrapper's signature to be known.

## Standing policy

1. **PROBE BEFORE GRIND.** The two biggest unblocks (maspsx stdin hang;
   `expand_load_immediate` forcing `ori`) were short diagnostics, not
   integrations. When a family is blocked, diagnose before more members.
2. **Homogeneous families may be batched.** Risk lives in the first member.
3. **`asm/` is not a source of truth for counts.** Use `configs/USA/disc1.yaml`.
4. **Commit messages are not evidence.** A claim is proven when a gate is green
   and the leaf is objdump-probed (not SHA alone on carves).
5. **No weak-int cheat:** do **not** invent width a narrower store contradicts
   (e.g. `sh`/`sb` → `int`). Distinct from **opaque-word** typing (consistent
   32-bit `sw`/`lw` everywhere) — that is a separate lead ruling, currently
   open under `TYPING-POLICY` in `parked_blockers.json`.
6. **Width-only setters are triaged in `parked_blockers.json`.**
   `READY-FROM-READER` (src reader already *types* it), `BLOCKED-ON-READER`
   (undecompiled reader not yet proven to be a mere use-site),
   `TYPING-POLICY` (opaque 32-bit word; use-site found, no narrowing possible),
   or `DECISION-BLOCKED` (write-only; no reader). A use-site is not a type-site
   (`func_800405A4` lesson). Re-check after every reader phase.
   `5EF-delay-slot` **CLOSED** (14/14 integrated); `sb-sh-five` reclassified
   typing-only.
7. **Register pinning is an evidence-backed fallback, not a shortcut.** Use it
   only after natural C and a retail-order phrasing retry prove that the
   residual is register **allocation**, not statement order. Pins must have
   semantic names and a source comment recording the allocation proof
   (`func_8006A8D4` exact; `func_8006A674` bounded parked example).

## Resolved blockers

- **Phase 5I** delay-slot (`move`/`or` vs `addu`): **SOLVED in 5EC** by era.
- **Maspsx non-TTY hang:** **SOLVED** (`</dev/null` in `era_compile`).
- **`lui;ori` large-literal synthesis:** **CAPABILITY-VERIFIED** (scratch probe;
  both sign cases; no flag change).
- **5EF delay-slot (sw in `j $31` slot):** **CLOSED in 5EF** by the
  vendored maspsx LOCAL PATCH (`MASPSX_FILL_STORE_DELAY_SLOT=1`). Key evidence:
  `func_8003FFAC` vs `func_8007FBC0` — identical C, different ROM scheduling
  (pre-jr+nop vs in-slot) ⇒ original units assembled under different ASPSX
  scheduling; behavior is opt-in per leaf. All 14 members are integrated exact;
  sb/sh never fill (ROM-proven).

| 5EG-first-branch | 206 | First branchy leaf `func_8004F448`; era cc1 `-O1 -G 8` hoists const into `beqz` delay slot word-exact (branch scheduling capability proven) |
| 5EH-arg-return | 207 | First value-returning leaf `func_800438C0` on era path: `-O2 -G8` preserves double store, `addu` return-0, era+gp proven; GCC 14.2 store-merge + `move` documented as $CC-path limits |
| 5EI-first-nonleaf | 208 | First non-leaf `func_800197D0` on era `-O2 -G8`: frame (`addiu $sp,∓0x18`, `sw/lw $ra,0x10($sp)`) + `jal func_800375B4`; teardown `addiu $sp,+0x18` lands **in the `jr` delay slot** word-exact |

| 5EL-return-forwarding | 211 | `func_8007F7A8` on era `-O2 -G0` forwards `func_8007FCAC`'s `$v0` untouched and reproduces retail's opposite epilogue schedule: teardown before `jr`, nop in the delay slot; all eight words exact |
| 5EM-boot-6a8d4 | 212 | First Rung-1 boot leaf: `func_8006A8D4` on era `-O2 -G0` lays out boot memory regions with 19 ordered absolute pointer stores; register-pinned byte cursors reproduce all 68 retail words exactly after two plain-local phrasings fail the retail register allocation/store schedule. Compiler-constrained, target-specific C is documented in source |
| maspsx indexed-store | 212 | Toolchain patch `f0b9155`: default-off `MASPSX_THREE_WORD_SYMBOL_STORE=1` opt-in adds the three-word symbol+register store form; exact 212-leaf regression, 148 tests, and live re-clone durability passed |
| 5EN/5EP-loop-probe | 212 | `func_8006A674` proves five `bnez`/`bgez` loop back-edge delay slots plus store-in-`jr`-slot; L2 and late allocation deltas cleared, but the leaf is parked with a 45-word `$v1` constant-hoist residual and no 213 claim |
