# ACTIVE HANDOFF

Single source of truth for current working state. Read this first; update after
every meaningful change. Prefer shortening over accruing.

## Current state

| Fact | Value | Derive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Branch / tip | `main` (Phase 5EG-setter) | `git branch --show-current` / `git log --oneline -1` |
| Phase | **5EG-setter** | `scripts/verify_us.sh` summary |
| Matching C leaves | **174** | `grep -c ',\s*c,' configs/USA/disc1.yaml` |
| Yaml asm segments | **129** | `grep -c ',\s*asm\]' configs/USA/disc1.yaml` |
| Era leaf compiles | **18** | `grep -c '^era_compile ' scripts/build_us.sh` |
| Target SHA-1 | `452fb033f2eaa4b18aa20a5bca60b8125af3a37b` | `scripts/build_us.sh` compare |
| Progress | https://blizz127.github.io/parasite-eve-progress/ | `scripts/publish_progress.sh` |

**128 is yaml `asm` segments, not remaining functions.** One segment can hold
dozens of glabels; do not subtract it from anything as a function count.

Oracle: bare `scripts/build_us.sh` exits 0 on exact SHA-1; `scripts/verify_us.sh`
reports Phase 5EG-setter / 174. Disc images / `asm/` / `build/` / `tools/era/`
are git-ignored inputs — never commit them.

**Toolchain**

- Default leaves: GCC 14.2 in Distrobox `pe-mipsel` (Phase 4J flags; selective
  `-G 8` / `-fno-delayed-branch` / `-fno-tree-ter`).
- Era leaves (opt-in): `scripts/setup_era.sh` → `era_compile` =
  cpp → cc1 → maspsx → GNU as, typically `-O2 -G0` (some leaves `-O1 -G0`).
- Era maspsx: `ERA_ASPSX_VER=2.21` + `--dont-expand-li`. **Why:**
  `expand_load_immediate` turns positive small `li` into `ori`; ROM wants
  `addiu`. Defer `li` expansion to GNU as. Do **not** bump aspsx-version
  casually — that also flips `nop_at_expansion` / `addiu_at`.
- Maspsx stdin: closed with `</dev/null` in `era_compile` (non-TTY hang under
  agent sockets). Bare `scripts/build_us.sh` is fine.

## How to count (do not hand-maintain)

```bash
grep -c ',\s*c,' configs/USA/disc1.yaml            # C leaves
grep -c ',\s*asm\]' configs/USA/disc1.yaml          # yaml asm segments (NOT fn count)
grep -c '^era_compile ' scripts/build_us.sh         # era leaf compiles
git log --oneline -1
```

**Do not** count `asm/disc1/*.s` from disk. That tree is git-ignored and
contains orphans, stale duplicates, and nop-pads. **Yaml is the source of truth.**

**asm/ sync invariant:** `$at` family totals from
`tools/analysis/at_absolute_store_counter.py` hard-fail (no SUMMARY) when asm/
is missing units or still holds glabels for yaml C leaves. Re-split with
`scripts/split_us.sh` before planning off a family count. Leaf count stays
yaml-only and still works when asm/ is stale.

## Proven era fingerprints (evidence, not claims)

| Fingerprint | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `move` → `addu` in delay slot | Proven 5EA / 5EB / 5EC / 5ED |
| `$v0` / `$v1` allocation | Proven 5EC / 5ED (sb+ret0 reuse) |
| `li` const materialization (`addiu` not `ori`) | Proven 5EC via `--dont-expand-li` |
| `$at` absolute `sw` macro expansion | Proven by scratch probe; integrated exact in 5EE |
| `lui;ori` constant synthesis | **UNTESTED AND UNQUEUED** — requires its own probe |

The “~290 era-blocked functions” figure from the 5EA commit message is an
**ESTIMATE**, partially supported by fingerprints above — **not** a verified
inventory. Do not treat it as a countdown.

## Known-open families

- **sb+ret0:** **done** in 5ED (family closed).
- **`$at` absolute `sw` (pre-jr):** population counter committed
  (`tools/analysis/at_absolute_store_counter.py`): **18 pre-jr** / 14 delay-slot /
  5 sb-sh. Weak-int policy **NO**.
  - **Pinned by 5EG-readers (not setters yet):**
    - `D_8009D240` = `unsigned short *`, `D_8009D260` = `unsigned char *`
      via `func_8008AB1C` (era `-O1 -G0`).
    - `D_800A1870` = `void (*)(void)` via `func_80042B6C` (era `-O2 -G0`);
      `func_80042BC8` decl corrected (emission unchanged).
  - **`func_80085728` integrated** (dual pre-jr store; types from `func_8008AB1C`).
  - **Still blocked:** 15 WIDTH-ONLY/WRITE-ONLY pre-jr setters (incl. write-only
    `D_800A1868`; `D_800A1874` WIDTH-ONLY co-used by `func_80042B6C` only).
  - **5EF:** delay-slot `sw` (incl. `func_8007DEA4` / `func_80080930`) separate.
- **`lui;ori`:** separate family; untested and unqueued.
- Complex `$gp` / GTE / BIOS / mult-div / large non-leaves: still open; not
  inventoried here.

## Standing policy

1. **PROBE BEFORE GRIND.** The two biggest unblocks (maspsx stdin hang;
   `expand_load_immediate` forcing `ori`) were short diagnostics, not
   integrations. When a family is blocked, diagnose before more members.
2. **Homogeneous families may be batched.** Risk lives in the first member.
3. **`asm/` is not a source of truth for counts.** Use `configs/USA/disc1.yaml`.
4. **Commit messages are not evidence.** A claim is proven when a gate is green
   and the leaf is objdump-probed (not SHA alone on carves).
5. **No weak-int:** WIDTH-ONLY/WRITE-ONLY globals are not declared from `sw`
   width alone. Need disambiguating readers, data-section evidence, or an
   explicit policy change.

## Resolved blockers

- **Phase 5I** delay-slot (`move`/`or` vs `addu`): **SOLVED in 5EC** by era.
- **Maspsx non-TTY hang:** **SOLVED** (`</dev/null` in `era_compile`).
