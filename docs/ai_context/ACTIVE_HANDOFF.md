# ACTIVE HANDOFF

Single source of truth for the current working state. Any agent or human
picking up this project reads this first and updates it after every
meaningful change.

## Current phase

**Phase 2 — first real split executed locally; disassembly sanity-checked at
pc0; guardrails extended for splat `include/` boilerplate.** Phase 1 is
complete locally; only the official redump cross-check remains open
(non-blocking). (Branch: `phase2-first-real-split`.)

## What exists right now

- Working extraction pipeline: `scripts/extract_us.sh [1|2|all]` drives
  three stdlib-only Python tools — `tools/extract/psxiso.py` (ISO9660
  reader for raw MODE2/2352 images), `tools/analysis/psxexe_info.py`
  (PS-X EXE header dump), `tools/verify/hashfile.py` (CRC-32/MD5/SHA-1).
- Both discs processed end-to-end with the **fixed** script; all results
  recorded in `docs/disc_info.md`. Extracted output lives only under
  `build/extracted/` (git-ignored).
- The extract script's fail-loudly defect is fixed: every step now carries
  explicit `|| return 1` (immune to `set -e` suppression in the `||`
  caller context) and the per-disc output dir is wiped at run start so
  stale results can't masquerade as success. Failure tests re-run
  2026-07-04: garbage image → exit 1 with ERROR (previously exit 0 with
  stale "OK"), missing images → exit 1, cue-without-bin → exit 1.
- `configs/USA/disc1.yaml` now contains a conservative minimal initial
  splat config built from verified Phase 1 values;
  `configs/USA/disc2.yaml` is a documented byte-identical disc 2
  pointer/alias, not a separate active config. **First real split run
  completed 2026-07-07** — local study artifacts under `asm/disc1/`,
  `linkers/disc1.ld`, `include/*.inc`, `undefined_*_auto.txt` (all
  git-ignored, never committed). No matching build, decompiled C, or
  PC-port work exists. `scripts/setup_env.sh` is implemented (pinned
  `.venv/` install); `verify_us.sh` is still a placeholder.

## What is verified

- Disc 1 (SLUS-00662) and disc 2 (SLUS-00668) local dumps: image and EXE
  hashes, PS-X EXE headers, SYSTEM.CNF boot lines, full ISO9660 listings
  (25 and 31 files) — see `docs/disc_info.md` for values and commands.
- **The two boot executables are byte-identical** (SHA-1
  `452fb033f2eaa4b18aa20a5bca60b8125af3a37b` on both) — one EXE target
  covers both discs. Entry with evidence in
  `docs/reverse_engineering_notes.md`.
- **`PE.IMG` is byte-identical across both discs** (SHA-1
  `146c0ce7308bf9fdc2ba5a84230e198db0663f3b`, verified 2026-07-04): the
  discs differ only in FMV/XA streams and volume metadata. The decomp
  target is one EXE plus one archive. Archive format unexplored.
- Both image dumps are corroborated by an independent third-party catalog
  with identical hashes (GitHub `portforge/portforge-mediaitems`, found
  via code search for our SHA-1s; recorded in docs/disc_info.md). Not an
  authoritative redump verification.

## Phase 2 state (this branch)

- `configs/USA/disc1.yaml` is now a real minimal splat config: header +
  one conservative `asm` segment covering the whole loadable image
  (0x800–0x1EE800 at vram 0x80010000). Every number in it is a verified
  Phase 1 fact; no internal boundaries or symbols are claimed.
- `configs/USA/disc2.yaml` is a documented pointer to disc 1 (the EXEs
  are byte-identical), deliberately not a duplicate config.
- `scripts/setup_env.sh` is now implemented: creates a git-ignored
  `.venv/` and installs the pinned `splat64[mips]==0.41.0` (latest PyPI
  release as of 2026-07-05, when the pin was decided — see "Open
  decisions" below, now closed). Idempotent; has repo-root and git-repo
  sanity guards.
- `scripts/split_us.sh` gained a `--check` dry-run mode (verifies repo
  root, config, extracted EXE presence + SHA-1, splat availability via
  `.venv/bin/splat` first then `PATH`, and that every output path is
  `git check-ignore`d — prints what a real run would generate, invokes
  nothing). A real run now also diffs `git status` before/after and
  fails loudly if the split produced anything not git-ignored. Verified
  2026-07-07: `scripts/setup_env.sh` created `.venv/` with splat64
  0.41.0; `scripts/split_us.sh --check` passes all six gates on this
  machine (no split invoked, git status clean); `bash -n` clean on all
  four `scripts/*.sh`.
- `.gitignore` covers splat output: `asm/`, `linkers/`, `assets/`,
  `.splache`, `undefined_*_auto.txt`, and splat boilerplate under
  `include/*.inc` / `include/*.h` (tracked `include/.gitkeep` preserved).
- `docs/splitting.md` documents the canonical target, verified values,
  unknowns, the pinned toolchain, the dry-run workflow, and the
  no-matching-claims policy.

### First split output (2026-07-07, local only)

Command: `scripts/split_us.sh` on branch `phase2-first-real-split`.
splat 0.41.0 reported **Split 2 MB (100.00%)** — header 2 KB, main asm
2 MB. Generated and git-ignored:

| Path | Present | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `asm/disc1/header.s` | yes | PS-X EXE header; pc0 `0x80072534`, t_addr `0x80010000` match Phase 1 |
| `asm/disc1/800.s` | yes | ~529k lines; single monolithic asm subsegment (expected) |
| `linkers/disc1.ld` | yes | `.main` at VRAM `0x80010000`; text/data/rodata/bss sections from one object |
| `undefined_syms_auto.txt` | yes | ~1438 auto data labels (`D_*`) |
| `undefined_funcs_auto.txt` | yes | ~468 auto func labels; many addresses outside load range (data-as-code noise) |
| `include/{macro,labels,gte_macros}.inc`, `include_asm.h` | yes | splat boilerplate copied on split |
| `assets/disc1/` | no | no asset subsegments in config — expected |
| `.splache` | no | not created by this splat 0.41.0 run — expected |

**pc0 sanity (`0x80072534`, file offset `0x62D34` in `800.s`):** plausible
Psy-Q-style C runtime startup — zero-fill loop over a RAM range, stack
pointer loaded from `D_8009CD70`/`D_8009CD74`, `$gp` set, `jal` to
auto-labeled `func_800726B4` then `func_8001220C`, ending in `break 0,1`.
Not a bare `j`/`jal` trampoline; consistent with crt0 calling into main.
**Image start (`0x80010000`):** jump table (`jtbl_80010000` with `.word`
targets in `0x80012xxx`) — plausible dispatch table, not random opcodes.

**Known limitations (expected, not bugs):** one asm file disassembles the
entire loadable image; data regions appear as instructions, `nonmatching`
labels, and out-of-range `func_*` entries in `undefined_funcs_auto.txt`.
No text/data/bss boundaries or real symbol names claimed.

**Guardrail fix on same date:** first run exited 1 because splat writes
boilerplate into tracked `include/` (alongside `include/.gitkeep`). Extended
`.gitignore` and `scripts/split_us.sh` `OUTPUT_PATHS`; re-run passes
post-split `git status` check.

## What is NOT verified

- Whether either dump matches redump.org itself (unreachable again on
  2026-07-04 retry, ECONNREFUSED; disc 1 page is
  http://redump.org/disc/116/). Non-blocking.
- Text/data/bss boundaries inside the image — split exists but config still
  uses one conservative asm segment; internal layout not mapped yet.
- Real symbol/function names — only splat auto-labels (`func_*`, `D_*`).
- The toolchain: `compiler: GCC` in the config is splat boilerplate, not a
  verified compiler identification (Phase 5+ fingerprinting).

## Next concrete step

1. **Phase 3 config refinement:** identify text vs data/rodata boundaries
   in `configs/USA/disc1.yaml` from disassembly patterns (jump tables,
   padding, high-entropy regions) — one boundary at a time, re-split
   locally, verify pc0 code still sane. Do not invent symbol names.
2. When redump.org is reachable, record the official cross-check in
   `docs/disc_info.md`.

## Open decisions

- License for original tooling/docs (see `docs/legal.md`).
- ~~Exact splat version / Python toolchain pinning~~ — decided
  2026-07-05: `splat64[mips]==0.41.0`, owned by `scripts/setup_env.sh`.
  Revisit only with a deliberate, recorded reason to bump.

## Rules reminder (never violate)

- No game data, images, extracted files, or SDK material in git.
- No invented decompiled C; no matching claims without the verify harness.
- Update this file after every meaningful change.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-07: **First real split:** `scripts/split_us.sh` on
  `phase2-first-real-split` — splat 0.41.0 split 2 MB (100%); pc0
  `0x80072534` sanity OK (crt0-style startup). Fixed guardrail gap:
  splat `include/*.inc`/`*.h` now git-ignored and in `OUTPUT_PATHS`.
  Re-run passes post-split git check. No asm/symbols/C committed.
- 2026-07-07: Phase 2 smoke test: `scripts/setup_env.sh` installed
  splat64 0.41.0 into `.venv/`; `scripts/split_us.sh --check` passed all
  gates (repo root, config, EXE SHA-1, splat, gitignore coverage). No
  split invoked; no asm/symbols/C generated or committed; git status
  clean.
- 2026-07-05: Phase 2 guardrails: implemented `scripts/setup_env.sh`
  (pinned `.venv/` install of `splat64[mips]==0.41.0`); added `--check`
  dry-run mode plus a post-split `git status` diff check to
  `scripts/split_us.sh`; added splat's root-level auto-generated symbol
  list files to `.gitignore`; documented the toolchain and dry-run
  workflow in `docs/splitting.md`. No split executed (splat still not
  installed on this machine); no asm/symbols/C generated or committed.
- 2026-07-04: Phase 2 started: authored minimal splat config for
  SLUS_006.62 (verified values only, single conservative segment),
  disc2.yaml documented as pointer to disc 1, split_us.sh implemented
  with tested fail-loudly gates, docs/splitting.md added. No split run
  yet (splat not installed); no asm generated or committed.
- 2026-07-04: Closed the PE.IMG hypothesis — verified byte-identical
  across discs (SHA-1 146c0ce7...). Redump retry still ECONNREFUSED;
  recorded independent third-party hash corroboration for both dumps.
- 2026-07-04: Fixed extract_us.sh fail-loudly blocker (explicit per-step
  error handling + fresh output dir per run; failure paths re-tested).
  Disc 2 verification pass recorded in docs/disc_info.md. First verified
  RE observation: both boot EXEs byte-identical. Redump cross-checks
  still pending for both discs.
- 2026-07-04: Phase 1 disc 1 verification: implemented extract_us.sh +
  psxiso.py/psxexe_info.py/hashfile.py, extracted and hashed SLUS_006.62
  locally, recorded all disc 1 facts in docs/disc_info.md. Redump
  cross-check pending (site unreachable). Disc 2 pending.
- 2026-07-04: Phase 0 scaffold created (structure, docs, placeholders).
