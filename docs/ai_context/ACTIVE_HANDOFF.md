# ACTIVE HANDOFF

Single source of truth for the current working state. Any agent or human
picking up this project reads this first and updates it after every
meaningful change.

## Current phase

**Phase 1 — disc verification and extraction. Complete locally; only the
official redump cross-check remains open.** (Branch:
`phase1-redump-and-peimg`.)

## What exists right now

- Working extraction pipeline: `scripts/extract_us.sh [1|2|all]` drives
  three stdlib-only Python tools — `tools/extract/psxiso.py` (ISO9660
  reader for raw MODE2/2352 images), `tools/analysis/psxexe_info.py`
  (PS-X EXE header dump), `tools/verify/hashfile.py` (CRC-32/MD5/SHA-1).
- Both discs processed end-to-end with the **fixed** script; all results
  recorded in `docs/disc_info.md`. Extracted output lives only under
  `build/extracted/` (git-ignored).
- The extract script's fail-loudly defect is fixed: every step now carries
  explicit `|| return 1` (immune to `set -e` suppression in the `||`
  caller context) and the per-disc output dir is wiped at run start so
  stale results can't masquerade as success. Failure tests re-run
  2026-07-04: garbage image → exit 1 with ERROR (previously exit 0 with
  stale "OK"), missing images → exit 1, cue-without-bin → exit 1.
- No disassembly, splat configs, symbols, or C exist. `split_us.sh`,
  `verify_us.sh`, `setup_env.sh`, and `configs/USA/*.yaml` are still
  placeholders.

## What is verified

- Disc 1 (SLUS-00662) and disc 2 (SLUS-00668) local dumps: image and EXE
  hashes, PS-X EXE headers, SYSTEM.CNF boot lines, full ISO9660 listings
  (25 and 31 files) — see `docs/disc_info.md` for values and commands.
- **The two boot executables are byte-identical** (SHA-1
  `452fb033f2eaa4b18aa20a5bca60b8125af3a37b` on both) — one EXE target
  covers both discs. Entry with evidence in
  `docs/reverse_engineering_notes.md`.
- **`PE.IMG` is byte-identical across both discs** (SHA-1
  `146c0ce7308bf9fdc2ba5a84230e198db0663f3b`, verified 2026-07-04): the
  discs differ only in FMV/XA streams and volume metadata. The decomp
  target is one EXE plus one archive. Archive format unexplored.
- Both image dumps are corroborated by an independent third-party catalog
  with identical hashes (GitHub `portforge/portforge-mediaitems`, found
  via code search for our SHA-1s; recorded in docs/disc_info.md). Not an
  authoritative redump verification.

## What is NOT verified

- Whether either dump matches redump.org itself (unreachable again on
  2026-07-04 retry, ECONNREFUSED; disc 1 page is
  http://redump.org/disc/116/).
- Anything about the EXE's internals (no disassembly yet — Phase 2+).

## Next concrete step

1. When redump.org is reachable, record the official cross-check for both
   discs in `docs/disc_info.md` (last blocker on Phase 1 closure).
2. Phase 2: author the first splat config for `SLUS_006.62` (one EXE
   covers both discs) — can start now; the redump check is not a
   prerequisite for beginning splat work.

## Open decisions

- License for original tooling/docs (see `docs/legal.md`).
- Exact splat version / Python toolchain pinning (decide in Phase 2;
  `scripts/setup_env.sh` will own installation).

## Rules reminder (never violate)

- No game data, images, extracted files, or SDK material in git.
- No invented decompiled C; no matching claims without the verify harness.
- Update this file after every meaningful change.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-04: Closed the PE.IMG hypothesis — verified byte-identical
  across discs (SHA-1 146c0ce7...). Redump retry still ECONNREFUSED;
  recorded independent third-party hash corroboration for both dumps.
- 2026-07-04: Fixed extract_us.sh fail-loudly blocker (explicit per-step
  error handling + fresh output dir per run; failure paths re-tested).
  Disc 2 verification pass recorded in docs/disc_info.md. First verified
  RE observation: both boot EXEs byte-identical. Redump cross-checks
  still pending for both discs.
- 2026-07-04: Phase 1 disc 1 verification: implemented extract_us.sh +
  psxiso.py/psxexe_info.py/hashfile.py, extracted and hashed SLUS_006.62
  locally, recorded all disc 1 facts in docs/disc_info.md. Redump
  cross-check pending (site unreachable). Disc 2 pending.
- 2026-07-04: Phase 0 scaffold created (structure, docs, placeholders).
